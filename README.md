# Commentist App

The Commentist is a network of podcasts with tens of thousands of listeners every week. The Commentist app will allow fans to stay up to date on all the latest episodes of their favorite shows. Users of the app will be able to stream all of the available episodes for these shows with a unique player, as well as view the description for each episode and see the hosts. Users will receive notifications when new episodes are available to stream. 

This project was created as the Capstone Project for the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree program.
